# Plot Easing Funcs

I wanted a local script to produce the plots/charts/graphs that Disco Diffusion notebooks have added recently.

This script does that.

## Install

From this directory:

```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

From this directory:

```terminal
python3 ./plot_easing_funcs.py
```
